### About Me:
I'm a full stack software engineer with a Bachelor of Science in Psychological and Brain Sciences and work experience in healthcare. I was drawn to software engineering because I sought to challenge myself and refine my logical reasoning skills, which I believed were weaknesses of mine. My background has enabled me to code with a user-centric approach and be an adaptable, team player. In my journey of learning different languages and frameworks, I have overcome much self-doubt and produced full stack applications from the relationships and designs I crafted early on. I love that creativity and logic are mutually inclusive in this field! I strive to learn something new every day and continue adding features to my projects.

- ðŸ”­ I'm in the process of implementing more features for my projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently practicing data structures and algorithms.
